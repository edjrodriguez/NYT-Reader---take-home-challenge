You will also need a need to sign-up/sign-in to the NYT developer site and establish an API key [here](https://developer.nytimes.com/get-started) and set-up an [env file](https://dev.to/anuradhasivasubramanian/5-things-to-remember-when-using-an-env-file-to-store-you-api-key-in-a-react-app-4f2o) within your cloned repo

After creating your env file and setting up the process.env variable in the apiCalls.js file, you will need to restart the local server in your terminal for the .env file changes to take effect.
